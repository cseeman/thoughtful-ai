## ðŸŒŸ Community Voices

> "I designed Ruby for humans, not for machines... Often people focus on the machines. But we need to focus on humans." â€” **Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto)**

> "Intelligence alone does not solve problems... We had to summon the elements of our character. Not our intelligence â€” our resilience." â€” **Bryan Cantrill**

> "Ruby is the most 'human' language I know: written for humans, with interesting human foibles, reads like human language." â€” **Sean Goedecke**

> "To work faster I leveraged an LLM assistant to be my hands... [solving] some of the trickiest Ruby metaprogramming problems I've ever seen." â€” **Avdi Grimm**

> "Vibe coding only works as well as the stack you're using... Rails encourages convention over configuration which helps AI understand code structure." â€” **JetRockets**
