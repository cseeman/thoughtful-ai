## Conclusion

These organizational frameworks provide complementary perspectives to NIST's explainability principles. While NIST focuses on technical explainability, these frameworks address governance, ethics, and the practical challenges of implementing responsible AI in organizational contexts.

For Ruby engineers using AI coding assistants, these frameworks help answer questions NIST doesn't directly address:
- How should our team govern AI tool usage?
- What trade-offs are we making, and are they appropriate?
- How do we balance innovation with responsibility?
- What does our organization value, and how does AI align?

By combining NIST's explainability principles with these organizational frameworks, Ruby teams can develop comprehensive, thoughtful approaches to AI tool adoption that serve both technical excellence and broader ethical responsibilities.
