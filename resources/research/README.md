# Scientific Research on AI and Human Cognition

*Research backing for the psychological considerations in thoughtful AI usage*

## ðŸ§  Context Switching Research

### The Cognitive Cost of Task Switching

**Key Findings:**
- **20% cognitive capacity loss** during context switches (PMC Research 2023)
- **15-25 minutes** to regain deep focus after interruption
- **Frontal and parietal lobes** respond when switching tasks unexpectedly (Wake Forest 2024)

**Implications for AI Usage:**
- Batch AI interactions to minimize context switching
- Use AI for entire logical units, not line-by-line
- Recognize when you need uninterrupted flow state
- Plan AI sessions during natural break points

## ðŸ¤– Automation Bias Research

### The Psychology of Trusting AI

**Key Findings:**
- **Professional experience** is the most protective factor against automation bias
- **Advanced AI knowledge** leads to more calibrated trust
- **Domain expertise** reduces over-reliance on AI suggestions
- **First impressions** of AI systems significantly influence long-term bias patterns

**Implications for Ruby Developers:**
- Your Ruby expertise is your best defense against automation bias
- Question every AI suggestion: "Does this feel Ruby-like?"
- Trust your instincts over AI confidence
- Remember: You're the Ruby expert, AI is just a tool

## ðŸŽ¯ Practical Applications

### For Ruby Developers

**Context Switching Mitigation:**
- Use AI for entire features, not individual lines
- Batch AI interactions during planning phases
- Set aside dedicated AI time blocks
- Use AI for research and scaffolding, not during deep coding

**Automation Bias Prevention:**
- Always review AI-generated code for Ruby idiomaticity
- Trust your Ruby instincts over AI suggestions
- Use AI for boilerplate, not business logic
- Maintain healthy skepticism about AI output

### For Teams

**Workflow Design:**
- Establish AI usage guidelines
- Create review processes for AI-generated code
- Share effective prompts and techniques
- Regular team discussions about AI experiences

**Quality Assurance:**
- Code reviews should include AI-generated code
- Test coverage for AI-assisted features
- Documentation of AI usage decisions
- Regular evaluation of AI tool effectiveness
