## ðŸŽ¯ Practical Applications

### For Ruby Developers

**Context Switching Mitigation:**

- Set aside dedicated AI time blocks
- Use AI for research and scaffolding, not during deep coding

**Automation Bias Prevention:**
- Always review AI-generated code for Ruby idiomaticity
- Trust your Ruby instincts over AI suggestions
- Use AI for boilerplate, not business logic
- Maintain healthy skepticism about AI output

### For Teams

**Workflow Design:**
- Establish AI usage guidelines
- Create review processes for AI-generated code
- Share effective prompts and techniques
- Regular team discussions about AI experiences

**Quality Assurance:**
- Code reviews should include AI-generated code
- Test coverage for AI-assisted features
- Documentation of AI usage decisions
