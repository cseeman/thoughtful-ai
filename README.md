# Thoughtful AI for the Rubyist

*A curated collection of AI prompts, examples, and workflows for senior Ruby engineers who want to use AI with intention and purpose.*

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for experienced Ruby developers who are newer to AI but want to leverage these tools thoughtfully. The focus is on maintaining Ruby's human-centered philosophy while using AI as a collaborative partner, not a replacement for human judgment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start with the basics**: Read the [Getting Started Guide](guides/getting-started/README.md)
2. **Explore prompts**: Browse the [prompts directory](prompts/) for your specific needs
3. **See examples**: Check out [before/after examples](examples/before-after/) to understand prompt effectiveness
4. **Try workflows**: Follow [complete workflows](examples/workflows/) for common development tasks

## 💎 Ruby Philosophy Meets AI

This repository follows Ruby's core principles and addresses the tension between AI efficiency and Ruby's human-centered philosophy:

- **MINASWAN**: Matz is Nice And So We Are Nice
- **Developer happiness**: AI should enhance, not hinder, your coding joy
- **Readability**: Generated code should be clear and expressive
- **Human-centered**: You remain the expert, AI is your tool

### The Ruby Way vs. The AI Way

As Matz said: *"I designed Ruby for humans, not for machines... Often people focus on the machines. But we need to focus on humans."*

The challenge is maintaining Ruby's expressiveness and readability while leveraging AI's capabilities. This repository shows you how to get the best of both worlds.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Ruby engineers** with any level of experience
- **Rails developers** familiar with conventions and best practices
- **Team leads** who want to introduce AI thoughtfully to their teams
- **Rubyists** who value code quality and maintainability

## 🛠️ AI Tools Covered

- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion and generation
- **Cursor** - AI-native editor with project context
- **Claude Code** - Terminal-based assistant
- **Continue.dev** - Open-source alternative
- **ChatGPT/Claude** - Code review and analysis

## 📚 Key Principles

1. **Context is King**: Always provide relevant background
2. **Ruby-Specific Instructions**: Mention style guides and patterns
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Build on AI suggestions
4. **Human Oversight**: Review and validate all AI output
5. **Quality First**: Maintain Ruby's standards and readability

### ⚠️ Important Psychological Considerations

**Automation Bias**: The tendency to assume AI knows more than humans. Remember: *You're the Ruby expert, AI is just a tool.* Professional experience is the best protection against automation bias.

**Context Switching Cost**: Research shows that each context switch costs 15-25 minutes to regain deep focus, and 20% of cognitive capacity is lost during switches. Batch your AI interactions to minimize disruption to your flow state.

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

AI works best when integrated into your existing Ruby workflow as a **collaborative partner**, not a replacement:

- **Planning**: AI for research and initial structure
- **Implementation**: AI for boilerplate, human for logic
- **Review**: AI for suggestions, human for decisions
- **Refinement**: Iterative improvement with AI assistance

### The "Vibe Coding" Advantage

Rails is particularly well-suited for AI collaboration because:
- **Convention over configuration** helps AI understand code structure
- **Predictable patterns** make AI suggestions more accurate
- **Token efficiency**: Rails uses "as few tokens as possible per-feature, while still being readable" (Sean Goedecke)

## ⚠️ When NOT to Use AI

- Complex business logic requiring deep domain knowledge
- Security-sensitive authentication and authorization
- Performance-critical optimizations
- Creative architectural decisions
- Custom DSL design and metaprogramming

## 🤝 Contributing

This repository is designed to grow with the Ruby community's experience with AI. Contributions are welcome:

- **New prompts** for specific Ruby scenarios
- **Before/after examples** showing prompt effectiveness
- **Workflow improvements** based on real-world usage
- **Tool recommendations** and experiences
