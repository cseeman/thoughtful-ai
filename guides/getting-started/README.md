# Getting Started with AI for Ruby Development

*A beginner's guide to using AI tools thoughtfully in Ruby development*

## üéØ Overview

This guide is designed for Ruby engineers who are new to AI tools but want to integrate them thoughtfully into their development workflow. Let's focus on maintaining Ruby's human-centered philosophy while leveraging AI as a collaborative partner.

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Choose your AI tool (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
- [ ] Set up your development environment
- [ ] Learn basic prompting techniques
- [ ] Start with simple use cases
- [ ] Practice with real code
- [ ] Review and validate all AI output

## üõ†Ô∏è Choosing Your AI Tool

### GitHub Copilot
- **Best for**: Code completion and generation
- **Cost**: $10/month (As of 9/25)

- **Cost**: $20/month (As of 9/25)
- **Integration**: Built-in AI editor
- **Strengths**: Project-wide context, natural language commands
- **Weaknesses**: Newer tool, learning curve

### Claude Code
- **Best for**: Terminal-focused developers
- **Cost**: $20/month (As of 9/25)
- **Integration**: Terminal-based
- **Strengths**: Understands entire codebases, git integration
- **Weaknesses**: Terminal-only interface

### Continue.dev
- **Best for**: Open-source enthusiasts
- **Cost**: Free (As of 9/25)
- **Integration**: VS Code, supports local models
- **Strengths**: Privacy control, customizable
- **Weaknesses**: Requires more setup

## üéØ Your First AI Session

### Step 1: Start Simple
Begin with basic code generation:

```
Create a Ruby method to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

Requirements:
- Follow Ruby Style Guide
- Include error handling for negative radius
- Add YARD documentation
- Use descriptive method names
```

### Step 2: Review the Output
Always review AI-generated code:
- Does it follow Ruby conventions?
- Is it readable and maintainable?
- Does it handle edge cases?
- Is the documentation clear?

### Step 3: Iterate and Improve
Use follow-up prompts to refine:

```
The method looks good, but can you add a constant for PI and make it more Ruby-like?
```

## üìã Essential Prompting Techniques

### 1. Context is King
Always provide relevant background:

```
Create a Rails model for a blog post in a Rails 7 application.

Context: This is for a personal blog where users can create, edit, and publish posts. The application uses Devise for authentication.
```

### 2. Be Specific About Requirements
List specific constraints and requirements:

```
Generate RSpec tests for this User model.

Requirements:
- Follow RSpec conventions
- Test all validations
- Test all associations
- Include edge cases
- Use factories for test data
- Add YARD documentation
```

### 3. Reference Style Guides
Always mention Ruby and Rails style guides:

```
Refactor this Ruby method following the Ruby Style Guide and Rails conventions.
```

### 4. Request Explanations
Ask AI to explain its approach:

```
Generate this code and explain your reasoning for the design decisions.
```

## üîÑ Common Workflows

### 1. New Feature Development
```
1. Plan the feature with AI
2. Generate scaffolding code
3. Implement business logic
4. Generate tests
5. Review and refine
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```
1. Describe the bug to AI
2. Ask for debugging suggestions
3. Generate fix with explanation
4. Test the solution
5. Review for edge cases
```

### 3. Code Review
```
1. Share code with AI
2. Ask for improvement suggestions
3. Generate refactored version
4. Compare approaches
5. Implement improvements
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-reliance on AI
- **Problem**: Accepting AI output without review
- **Solution**: Always validate and understand the code

### 2. Vague Prompts
- **Problem**: "Make this better"
- **Solution**: Be specific about what you want

### 3. Ignoring Ruby Conventions
- **Problem**: AI generates non-idiomatic Ruby
- **Solution**: Always reference Ruby Style Guide

### 4. Skipping Tests
- **Problem**: Not generating tests for AI code
- **Solution**: Always request test generation

### 5. Context Switching
- **Problem**: Constantly switching between coding and AI
- **Solution**: Batch AI interactions, work in focused sessions

## üé® Best Practices

### 1. Start with Small Tasks
- Generate simple methods
- Create basic tests
- Write documentation
- Refactor small functions

### 2. Build Up Complexity
- Move to larger classes
- Generate complex tests
- Create service objects
- Refactor entire modules

### 3. Always Review
- Check for Ruby idiomaticity
- Verify business logic
- Ensure test coverage
- Validate error handling

### 4. Learn from AI
- Study the patterns AI uses
- Understand the reasoning
- Apply learnings to future code
- Share insights with team
