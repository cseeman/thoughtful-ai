# Troubleshooting AI for Ruby Development

*Common problems and solutions when using AI tools with Ruby*

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide addresses common issues you'll encounter when using AI tools for Ruby development. Each problem includes symptoms, causes, and solutions to help you get back on track quickly.

## ðŸš¨ Common Problems

### 1. AI Generates Non-Idiomatic Ruby

#### Symptoms
- Verbose, Java-like code
- Explicit nil checks everywhere
- Unnecessary return statements
- Missing Ruby conventions

#### Example
```ruby
# AI-generated (not Ruby-like)
def get_user_by_id(user_id)
  if user_id != nil
    user = User.where(id: user_id).first
    if user != nil
      return user
    else
      return nil
    end
  else
    return nil
  end
end
```

#### Solutions
1. **Reference Ruby Style Guide in prompts**:
   ```
   Generate this method following the Ruby Style Guide exactly.
   ```

2. **Provide examples of idiomatic Ruby**:
   ```
   Write this method in idiomatic Ruby style, similar to:
   def find_user(id)
     User.find_by(id: id)
   end
   ```

3. **Use follow-up prompts**:
   ```
   Refactor this to be more Ruby-like and idiomatic.
   ```

### 2. AI Doesn't Understand Rails Conventions

#### Symptoms
- Missing Rails helpers
- Incorrect RESTful patterns
- Poor parameter handling
- Missing callbacks

#### Example
```ruby
# AI-generated (not Rails-like)
def create
  @post = Post.new
  @post.title = params[:title]
  @post.content = params[:content]
  @post.save
  redirect_to "/posts/#{@post.id}"
end
```

#### Solutions
1. **Specify Rails version and conventions**:
   ```
   Create a Rails 7 controller following Rails conventions exactly.
   ```

2. **Reference Rails guides**:
   ```
   Follow Rails conventions for strong parameters and RESTful actions.
   ```

3. **Provide Rails context**:
   ```
   This is a Rails 7 application using Devise for authentication.
   ```

### 3. AI Generates Insecure Code

#### Symptoms
- Missing input validation
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure authentication

#### Example
```ruby
# AI-generated (insecure)
def search
  @users = User.where("name LIKE '%#{params[:query]}%'")
end
```

#### Solutions
1. **Always mention security requirements**:
   ```
   Generate this code with security best practices in mind.
   ```

2. **Request specific security measures**:
   ```
   Include input validation, SQL injection prevention, and XSS protection.
   ```

3. **Review security-sensitive code manually**:
   - Never trust AI with authentication logic
   - Always validate AI-generated database queries
   - Check for proper input sanitization

### 4. AI Doesn't Handle Edge Cases

#### Symptoms
- Missing error handling
- No validation for edge cases
- Assumptions about input data
- Missing boundary conditions

#### Example
```ruby
# AI-generated (missing edge cases)
def calculate_discount(price, percentage)
  price * (percentage / 100)
end
```

#### Solutions
1. **Explicitly request edge case handling**:
   ```
   Include error handling for edge cases like negative values and zero inputs.
   ```

2. **Provide specific edge cases**:
   ```
   Handle these edge cases: negative prices, zero percentage, nil values.
   ```

3. **Request comprehensive testing**:
   ```
   Generate tests that cover all edge cases and error scenarios.
   ```

### 5. AI Generates Poor Test Coverage

#### Symptoms
- Missing edge case tests
- No error scenario tests
- Poor test organization
- Missing integration tests

#### Example
```ruby
# AI-generated (incomplete tests)
RSpec.describe User do
  it "creates a user" do
    user = User.create(name: "John")
    expect(user).to be_valid
  end
end
```

#### Solutions
1. **Request comprehensive test coverage**:
   ```
   Generate tests with 100% coverage including edge cases and error scenarios.
   ```

2. **Specify test requirements**:
   ```
   Test all validations, associations, methods, and edge cases.
   ```

3. **Request test organization**:
   ```
   Organize tests with descriptive describe/context blocks.
   ```

### 6. AI Doesn't Understand Your Codebase

#### Symptoms
- Generates code that doesn't fit your patterns
- Missing your specific conventions
- Doesn't use your existing gems
- Ignores your architecture

#### Solutions
1. **Provide codebase context**:
   ```
   This is a Rails 7 application using Devise, Sidekiq, and RSpec.
   Follow the existing patterns in this codebase.
   ```

2. **Share existing code examples**:
   ```
   Follow the same pattern as this existing controller:
   [paste example code]
   ```

3. **Reference your style guide**:
   ```
   Follow our team's Ruby style guide and Rails conventions.
   ```

### 7. AI Generates Overly Complex Code

#### Symptoms
- Unnecessary abstractions
- Over-engineered solutions
- Complex metaprogramming
- Hard to understand code

#### Example
```ruby
# AI-generated (overly complex)
class UserProcessor
  def self.process_users(users)
    users.map do |user|
      UserProcessor.new(user).process
    end
  end

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def process
    # Complex processing logic
  end
end
```

#### Solutions
1. **Request simple solutions**:
   ```
   Generate a simple, straightforward solution without over-engineering.
   ```

2. **Specify complexity constraints**:
   ```
   Keep this solution simple and avoid unnecessary abstractions.
   ```

3. **Ask for explanation**:
   ```
   Explain why you chose this approach and suggest simpler alternatives.
   ```

### 8. AI Doesn't Follow Your Naming Conventions

#### Symptoms
- Inconsistent naming
- Wrong method names
- Poor variable names
- Missing conventions

#### Solutions
1. **Specify naming conventions**:
   ```
   Use snake_case for methods and variables, PascalCase for classes.
   ```

2. **Provide naming examples**:
   ```
   Follow our naming convention: find_user_by_email, not getUserByEmail.
   ```

3. **Request consistent naming**:
   ```
   Ensure all method names follow Ruby conventions and are descriptive.
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Troubleshooting

### 1. AI Generates Code That Doesn't Work

#### Symptoms
- Syntax errors
- Runtime errors
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect API usage

#### Solutions
1. **Request working code**:
   ```
   Generate working, runnable code that follows Ruby syntax exactly.
   ```

2. **Specify dependencies**:
   ```
   This code should work with Rails 7 and Ruby 3.2.
   ```

3. **Request error handling**:
   ```
   Include proper error handling and validation.
   ```

### 2. AI Generates Code That's Too Slow

#### Symptoms
- N+1 queries
- Inefficient algorithms
- Missing database indexes
- Poor performance

#### Solutions
1. **Request performance considerations**:
   ```
   Generate this code with performance optimization in mind.
   ```

2. **Specify performance requirements**:
   ```
   This code should handle 1000+ records efficiently.
   ```

3. **Request query optimization**:
   ```
   Optimize database queries and avoid N+1 problems.
   ```

### 3. AI Generates Code That's Hard to Test

#### Symptoms
- Tightly coupled code
- Hard to mock dependencies
- Missing test interfaces
- Poor testability

#### Solutions
1. **Request testable code**:
   ```
   Generate code that's easily testable with proper dependency injection.
   ```

2. **Specify testing requirements**:
   ```
   Make this code testable by using dependency injection and interfaces.
   ```

3. **Request test examples**:
   ```
   Generate both the code and comprehensive tests for it.
   ```
