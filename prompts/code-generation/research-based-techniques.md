## üß† Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**Research Finding**: Asking AI to "think step by step" significantly improves reasoning accuracy, especially for complex code transformations.

**Source**: Learn Prompting (2024), OpenAI Best Practices

### Ruby Example: Refactoring

**Prompt:**
```
You are refactoring Ruby code following SOLID principles.

Analyze this method step-by-step:
1. Identify code smells or violations of Ruby idioms
2. List specific improvements that would make it more Ruby-like
3. Explain why each improvement is better
4. Show the refactored version

Constraints:
- Maximum 5 lines for the refactored method
- Use Ruby enumerable methods where applicable
- Follow the Ruby Style Guide
- Preserve the original functionality

Method to refactor:
```ruby
def calculate_total(items)
  total = 0
  items.each do |item|
    if item.active == true
      total = total + item.price
    end
  end
  return total
end
```

Please follow the 4-step analysis before showing the refactored code.
```

**Why this works:**
- Forces AI to analyze before generating code
- Catches Ruby anti-patterns early
- Provides explanation alongside solution
- Results in more idiomatic Ruby

## üìè Constraint-Based Prompting

**Research Finding**: Specific constraints guide AI toward better, more focused solutions.

**Source**: DigitalOcean Prompt Engineering Best Practices (2024)

### Ruby Example: Method Simplification

**Prompt:**
```
Simplify this Ruby method with these constraints:
- Maximum 5 lines
- Use Ruby enumerable methods (map, select, reduce, etc.)
- No explicit return statements
- Follow Ruby Style Guide naming
- Must handle empty arrays gracefully

Current method:
```ruby
def active_user_emails(users)
  result = []
  users.each do |user|
    if user.active?
      result << user.email
    end
  end
  return result
end
```
```

**Result:**
```ruby
def active_user_emails(users)
  users.select(&:active?).map(&:email)
end
```

**Why this works:**
- Line limits force conciseness
- Enumerable constraint promotes Ruby idioms
- Removes common Ruby anti-patterns (explicit return, unnecessary variables)

## üîç Few-Shot Learning (Show Your Code)

**Research Finding**: Showing 1-3 examples from your actual codebase dramatically improves output quality.

**Source**: Prompt Engineering Guide (2024), Rich Steinmetz Rails Dev Practices

### Ruby Example: RSpec Test Generation

**Prompt:**
```
You are writing RSpec tests for a Rails application using FactoryBot.

Example from our codebase:
```ruby
RSpec.describe Article, type: :model do
  let(:article) { create(:article) }

  describe 'validations' do
    it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:title) }
    it { is_expected.to validate_uniqueness_of(:slug) }
  end

  describe '#published?' do
    it 'returns true when published_at is set' do
      article.published_at = Time.current
      expect(article.published?).to be true
    end
  end
end
```

Now write similar RSpec tests for the User model with:
- email presence validation
- email uniqueness validation
- email format validation
- #full_name method that combines first_name and last_name
```

**Why this works:**
- AI mimics your exact code style
- Maintains consistency across test suite
- Follows your team's conventions
- Reduces post-generation edits

## üé≠ Role-Based Prompting

**Research Finding**: Assigning a specific role/persona improves output quality by setting context expectations.

**Source**: OpenAI Best Practices (2024), freeCodeCamp Prompt Engineering

### Ruby Example: Code Review

**Prompt:**
```
You are a senior Ruby developer and code reviewer with 10+ years of Rails experience.

Context: Pull request for user authentication feature
Rails Version: 7.1
Testing: RSpec

Review this code for:
- Ruby idiomaticity
- Rails best practices
- Security concerns
- Performance issues
- Test coverage gaps

Code:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def authenticate(password)
    if self.password == password
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end
end
```

Provide specific, actionable feedback following Ruby community standards.
```

**Why this works:**
- Sets expertise level expectations
- Focuses on specific review criteria
- Encourages critical analysis
- Results in professional-grade feedback

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Negative Instructions

**Research Finding**: AI often fixates on what you tell it NOT to do, resulting in worse outcomes.

**Source**: Rich Steinmetz Rails Dev Practices (2024)

### Ruby Example: Asset Management

**‚ùå Ineffective (Negative Instructions):**
```
Write a Rails 7 asset configuration.
Don't use Webpack.
Don't use Sprockets.
Don't configure Node.js paths.
```

**‚úÖ Effective (Positive Instructions):**
```
Write a Rails 7 asset configuration using:
- Importmap for JavaScript
- Propshaft for assets
- Rails 7 default asset pipeline
```

**Why this works:**
- AI focuses on what TO do, not what to avoid
- Clearer direction leads to better results
- Reduces confusion and hallucinations

---

## üì¶ Context Management

**Research Finding**: LLMs work best with maximum relevant context and minimum irrelevant context.

**Source**: reinteractive Ruby AI Prompting (2024), DigitalOcean Best Practices

### Ruby Example: Bug Fix

**‚ùå Ineffective (Too Much Context):**
```
[Pastes entire 500-line controller file]
"Fix the bug"
```

**‚úÖ Effective (Focused Context):**
```
Context: Rails 7.1 application, UsersController
Issue: Password reset tokens aren't expiring
Relevant code:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb (lines 45-52)
def generate_reset_token
  self.reset_token = SecureRandom.hex(32)
  self.reset_sent_at = Time.current
  save
end

def reset_token_expired?
  reset_sent_at < 2.hours.ago
end
```

Task: Fix the expiration logic and ensure tokens can't be reused.
```

**Why this works:**
- AI focuses on relevant code only
- Faster response times
- More accurate solutions
- Easier to review suggestions

---

## üîß Specify Libraries and Versions

**Research Finding**: AI is trained on multiple versions of frameworks - being specific improves accuracy.

**Source**: Prompt Engineering Guide (2024), Rails Community Practices

### Ruby Example: Active Record Query

**‚ùå Ineffective (Vague):**
```
Write an Active Record query to find users
```

**‚úÖ Effective (Version-Specific):**
```
Rails 7.1 application using PostgreSQL

Write an ActiveRecord query that:
- Finds users created in the last 30 days
- Who have confirmed their email
- Orders by most recent first
- Uses Rails 7.1 syntax
- Avoids N+1 queries (use includes/joins)
- Limits to 20 results

Use method chaining for readability.
```

**Result:**
```ruby
User.where(created_at: 30.days.ago..)
    .where.not(confirmed_at: nil)
    .order(created_at: :desc)
    .limit(20)
```

**Why this works:**
- Rails 7.1 syntax (.. range operator)
- Correct ActiveRecord patterns
- No deprecated methods
- Production-ready code

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Prompting

**Research Finding**: Self-checking questions catch automation bias and improve code quality.

**Source**: Talk Survey Data (2024), Automation Bias Research

### Ruby Example: Self-Review

**Prompt:**
```
After generating the code, answer these questions:

1. Does this feel Ruby-like? (idiomatic patterns, no unnecessary verbosity)
2. Are there potential edge cases I missed?
3. Is this code easily testable?
4. Would a Rails developer naturally write it this way?
5. Are there any performance concerns?

Now generate a Rails service object for processing bulk user imports from CSV.
```

**Why this works:**
- Catches automation bias before you accept code
- Encourages critical thinking
- Identifies edge cases early
- Promotes the "Does this feel Ruby-like?" mindset

---

## üé® Output Format Specification

**Research Finding**: Explicitly stating desired output format improves parseable results.

**Source**: OpenAI Best Practices (2024), Prompt Engineering Guide

### Ruby Example: Migration Generation

**Prompt:**
```
Generate a Rails migration with this exact format:

1. Start with: class AddSocialMediaToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
2. Use def change (not up/down unless necessary)
3. Include inline comments for complex operations
4. Ensure reversibility
5. Follow Rails naming conventions

Task: Add social media columns to users table
- twitter_handle (string, nullable)
- github_username (string, nullable)
- linkedin_url (string, nullable)
- profile_public (boolean, default: false)
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear structural expectations
- Consistent formatting
- Follows conventions
- Ready to use without edits

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Hints

**Research Finding**: "Starter" hints guide AI toward correct patterns.

**Source**: Coding Prompt Techniques (2024)

### Ruby Example: Service Object

**Prompt:**
```
Create a Rails service object following this structure:

Start with:
```ruby
class UserRegistrationService
  def initialize(params)
    # Your code here
  end

  def call
    # Your code here
  end

  private

  # helper methods
end
```

Requirements:
- Follow the "call" pattern
- Return a Result object (success/failure)
- Handle validation errors
- Create user record
- Send welcome email
- Use dependency injection for mailer
```

**Why this works:**
- Structural hints guide implementation
- Follows established patterns
- Maintains architectural consistency
- Results in production-ready code
