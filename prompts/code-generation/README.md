## üéØ Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more context you provide, the better the output
2. **Mention Constraints**: Specify what you don't want as well as what you do
3. **Request Explanations**: Ask AI to explain its approach
4. **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to refine the output
5. **Validate**: Always review generated code for Ruby idiomaticity
