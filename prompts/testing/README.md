# Testing Prompts

*AI prompts for generating comprehensive Ruby and Rails tests with RSpec*

## üéØ Overview

Testing with AI requires careful prompting to ensure comprehensive coverage, proper test structure, and Ruby testing best practices. These prompts help you generate tests that are maintainable, readable, and effective.

## üìã Best Practices

- **Specify testing framework**: Always mention RSpec, Minitest, etc.
- **Include edge cases**: Request tests for boundary conditions
- **Mock external dependencies**: Specify what should be mocked
- **Follow testing conventions**: Use proper describe/context/it structure
- **Request explanations**: Ask AI to explain test strategy

## üéØ Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Include all requirements and constraints
2. **Request Edge Cases**: Always ask for boundary condition tests
3. **Mock Dependencies**: Specify what should be mocked
4. **Validate Output**: Review generated tests for completeness
5. **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to add missing test cases
