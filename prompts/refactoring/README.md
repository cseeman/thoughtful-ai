# Refactoring Prompts

*AI prompts for improving existing Ruby code while maintaining functionality and readability*

## üéØ Overview

Refactoring with AI requires careful prompting to ensure the output maintains Ruby's expressiveness and follows best practices. These prompts help you improve code quality while preserving the original intent.

## üìã Best Practices

- **Preserve functionality**: Always specify that behavior must remain unchanged
- **Maintain readability**: Request explanations for complex changes
- **Follow style guides**: Reference Ruby and Rails style guides
- **Incremental changes**: Break large refactoring into smaller steps
- **Test coverage**: Ensure refactoring doesn't break existing tests

## üéØ Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Refactor one method or class at a time
2. **Preserve Tests**: Ensure existing tests still pass
3. **Document Changes**: Ask AI to explain its refactoring approach
4. **Validate Output**: Always review refactored code for Ruby idiomaticity
5. **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to refine the refactoring
