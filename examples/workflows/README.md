# AI Workflow Examples for Ruby Developers

*Real-world workflows from the Ruby community for integrating AI thoughtfully into development*

## üéØ Overview

These workflows are based on community discussions, expert insights, and proven practices from experienced Ruby developers. Each workflow demonstrates how to use AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining Ruby's human-centered philosophy.

## üöÄ Featured Workflows

### 1. [Rich Steinmetz's Rails Development Workflow](rich-steinmetz-rails-workflow.md)
*Based on "How I use AI coding tools as a Rails dev"*

### 2. [Vibe Coding Workflow](vibe-coding-workflow.md)
*Based on JetRockets' "Why Ruby on Rails Is the Best Stack for Vibe Coding"*

### 3. [Avdi Grimm's Metaprogramming Workflow](avdi-grimm-metaprogramming-workflow.md)
*Based on his experience with complex Ruby metaprogramming*

### 4. [Collaborative Pair Programming Workflow](collaborative-pair-programming-workflow.md)
*AI as a pair programming partner*

### 5. [Context-Switching Optimized Workflow](context-switching-optimized-workflow.md)
*Minimizing cognitive load and maintaining flow state*

## üìã Workflow Categories

### By Development Phase
- **Planning & Architecture**: AI for research and initial structure
- **Implementation**: AI for boilerplate, human for logic
- **Testing**: AI for test generation and edge cases
- **Review & Refinement**: AI for suggestions, human for decisions

### By Ruby Expertise Level
- **Beginner**: Safe AI usage with heavy human oversight
- **Intermediate**: Balanced collaboration with AI
- **Advanced**: AI as specialized tool for complex tasks

### By Team Size
- **Solo Developer**: Personal AI workflow optimization
- **Small Team**: Shared AI practices and code review
- **Large Team**: Standardized AI usage and guidelines

## üéØ Key Principles Across All Workflows

1. **Human Oversight**: Always review and validate AI output
2. **Context Awareness**: Provide relevant background for better results
3. **Ruby Idiomaticity**: Ensure generated code follows Ruby conventions
4. **Quality First**: Maintain readability and maintainability
5. **Collaborative Approach**: AI as partner, not replacement

## üîÑ Workflow Integration Tips

### Batch AI Interactions
- Group related AI requests together
- Minimize context switching
- Plan AI sessions during natural break points

### Maintain Flow State
- Use AI for entire logical units
- Avoid line-by-line AI assistance during deep coding
- Recognize when you need uninterrupted focus

### Quality Assurance
- Always test AI-generated code
- Review for Ruby idiomaticity
- Check for security and performance implications

## üìö Community Insights

### Rails Developer Workflow Priorities (Rich Steinmetz)
1. **Debugging errors** - AI for error analysis and solutions
2. **Autocompletion** - AI for code completion and suggestions
3. **Code & tests** - AI for scaffolding and test generation
4. **Technical questions** - AI for explanations and research
5. **Code formatting** - AI for style and convention compliance
6. **Architecture** - Human-led with AI assistance

### Vibe Coding Principles (JetRockets)
- **Convention over configuration** helps AI understand code structure
- **Predictable patterns** make AI suggestions more accurate
- **Token efficiency** - Rails uses minimal tokens while remaining readable
- **Human-in-the-loop** development approach

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Specific Workflows

### GitHub Copilot Workflow
- Focus on autocomplete and code generation
- Use for boilerplate and repetitive tasks
- Great for Rails scaffolding

### Cursor Workflow
- Leverage project-wide context
- Use natural language commands
- Excellent for refactoring and architecture

### Claude Code Workflow
- Terminal-based development
- Git integration and command execution
- Perfect for Ruby developers who prefer CLI

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Individual Developer
- Reduced time on boilerplate tasks
- Improved code quality and consistency
- Faster learning of new Ruby patterns
- Better test coverage

### Team Benefits
- Standardized code patterns
- Improved knowledge sharing
- Faster onboarding of new developers
- Consistent documentation
