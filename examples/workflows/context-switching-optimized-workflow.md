# Context-Switching Optimized Workflow

*Minimizing cognitive load and maintaining flow state while using AI effectively*

## üß† The Context Switching Problem

Research shows that each context switch costs **15-25 minutes** to regain deep focus, and **20% of cognitive capacity** is lost during switches. This workflow is designed to minimize these costs while maximizing AI effectiveness.

## üéØ Workflow Philosophy

**Batch AI interactions** to minimize context switching and maintain flow state. Use AI for entire logical units rather than line-by-line assistance.

## üìã Context-Switching Optimized Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Research (AI Batch Session)
```
Duration: 30-45 minutes
Focus: High-level planning and research

Activities:
1. Research new features or requirements with AI
2. Get architectural suggestions and patterns
3. Plan implementation approach
4. Generate initial code structure
5. Set up development environment

Example AI Session:
- "Research Rails patterns for user authentication with role-based access"
- "Suggest architecture for a multi-tenant SaaS application"
- "Generate initial model structure for an e-commerce system"
- "Plan test strategy for the new feature"
```

### Phase 2: Deep Development (Minimal AI)
```
Duration: 2-3 hours
Focus: Uninterrupted coding flow

Activities:
1. Implement business logic manually
2. Write complex algorithms
3. Debug intricate issues
4. Refactor and optimize code
5. Focus on creative problem-solving

AI Usage: Minimal, only for specific questions
- Quick lookups for syntax or methods
- Error explanations when stuck
- Avoid line-by-line AI assistance
```

### Phase 3: AI-Assisted Implementation (Focused Batch)
```
Duration: 45-60 minutes
Focus: Boilerplate and repetitive tasks

Activities:
1. Generate test suites
2. Create documentation
3. Implement standard patterns
4. Generate migration files
5. Create API endpoints

Example AI Session:
- "Generate comprehensive RSpec tests for the User model"
- "Create API documentation for all endpoints"
- "Generate migration files for the new schema"
- "Create controller actions with proper error handling"
```

### Phase 4: Review & Refinement (AI Batch Session)
```
Duration: 30-45 minutes
Focus: Code review and improvement

Activities:
1. Review AI-generated code
2. Refine and optimize
3. Add missing edge cases
4. Improve error handling
5. Finalize documentation

Example AI Session:
- "Review this code for Ruby best practices"
- "Add error handling for edge cases"
- "Optimize database queries"
- "Generate final documentation"
```

## üîÑ Daily Workflow Structure

### Morning: AI Planning Session (9:00-9:45 AM)
```
- Research and planning
- Architecture decisions
- Environment setup
- Initial code generation
```

### Mid-Morning: Deep Development (10:00 AM-12:00 PM)
```
- Uninterrupted coding
- Complex problem-solving
- Business logic implementation
- Minimal AI interaction
```

### Afternoon: AI Implementation Session (1:00-2:00 PM)
```
- Test generation
- Documentation

- Standard patterns
```

### Late Afternoon: Review & Polish (3:00-4:00 PM)
```
- Code review
- Refinement
- Final testing
- Documentation updates
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Context-Switching Optimization Techniques

### 1. Batch Similar Tasks
```
‚ùå Scattered AI interactions throughout the day
‚úÖ Dedicated AI sessions for similar tasks

Example:
- Morning: All planning and research
- Afternoon: All test generation
- Evening: All documentation
```

### 2. Use AI for Complete Units
```
‚ùå "Help me write this method line by line"
‚úÖ "Generate a complete service class for user registration with validation, error handling, and tests"
```

### 3. Prepare AI Sessions
```
‚ùå Random AI questions throughout coding
‚úÖ Prepare a list of AI tasks and handle them in batches

Example AI Session Preparation:
- Generate tests for User model
- Create API documentation
- Review code for best practices
- Generate migration files
- Create error handling patterns
```

### 4. Minimize Interruptions
```
‚ùå Constantly switching between coding and AI
‚úÖ Set aside dedicated time blocks for each activity

Schedule:
- 9:00-9:45 AM: AI planning
- 10:00 AM-12:00 PM: Deep coding
- 1:00-2:00 PM: AI implementation
- 3:00-4:00 PM: Review and polish
```

## üéØ Flow State Preservation

### During Deep Development
```
- Turn off AI notifications
- Use full-screen mode
- Close unnecessary applications
- Set phone to do not disturb
- Work on single logical unit
```

### AI Session Preparation
```
- Prepare list of AI tasks
- Gather all necessary context
- Set clear objectives
- Allocate sufficient time
- Minimize external interruptions
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Context-Switching Pitfalls

### 1. Constant AI Interruption
- **Problem**: Checking AI suggestions while coding
- **Solution**: Batch AI interactions in dedicated sessions

### 2. Incomplete AI Sessions
- **Problem**: Starting AI tasks but not finishing them
- **Solution**: Allocate sufficient time for complete AI sessions

### 3. Mixed Task Types
- **Problem**: Mixing planning, coding, and review in same session
- **Solution**: Separate different types of tasks into different sessions

### 4. Insufficient Preparation
- **Problem**: Starting AI sessions without clear objectives
- **Solution**: Prepare AI tasks and context beforehand
