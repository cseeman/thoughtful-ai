# Rich Steinmetz's Rails Development Workflow

*Based on "How I use AI coding tools as a Rails dev" - A practical workflow for experienced Rails developers*

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Profile

- **Role**: Senior Rails Developer
- **Experience**: 5+ years Ruby/Rails
- **Team Size**: Small to medium teams
- **Primary AI Tools**: GitHub Copilot, Claude Code
- **Focus**: Production Rails applications

## üéØ Workflow Philosophy

Rich emphasizes using AI tools to **augment human expertise** rather than replace it. The key is leveraging AI for tasks where it excels while maintaining human judgment for complex decisions.

## üìã Rails Developer Workflow Priorities

Based on Rich's experience, here's the priority order for AI usage in Rails development:

### 1. üêõ Debugging Errors (Highest Priority)
**AI excels at**: Error analysis, solution suggestions, stack trace interpretation

**Workflow**:
```
1. Copy error message and stack trace to AI
2. Provide context about what you were trying to do
3. Ask for explanation and potential solutions
4. Review suggestions and implement the best approach
5. Test the fix thoroughly
```

**Example Prompt**:
```
I'm getting this error in my Rails app:

[Paste error message and stack trace]

Context: I was trying to implement a user authentication system using Devise. The error occurs when a user tries to sign in.

Can you help me understand what's causing this error and suggest a fix?
```

### 2. ‚ö° Autocompletion (Daily Use)
**AI excels at**: Code completion, method suggestions, parameter hints

**Workflow**:
```
1. Start typing method or class name
2. Review AI suggestions
3. Accept suggestions that follow Rails conventions
4. Modify suggestions that don't fit your needs
5. Continue with next logical step
```

**Best Practices**:
- Accept suggestions for standard Rails methods
- Review suggestions for custom business logic
- Use for repetitive patterns (validations, associations)

### 3. üß™ Writing Code and Tests (Core Development)
**AI excels at**: Test scaffolding, boilerplate generation, standard patterns

**Workflow**:
```
1. Generate initial code structure with AI
2. Review and modify for business logic
3. Generate corresponding tests
4. Review test coverage and edge cases
5. Refine both code and tests iteratively
```

**Example Prompt**:
```
Generate a Rails controller for managing blog posts with standard CRUD operations.

Requirements:
- Follow Rails conventions
- Include proper error handling
- Use strong parameters
- Add appropriate before_action filters
- Include flash messages

Then generate comprehensive RSpec tests for this controller.
```

### 4. ‚ùì Technical Questions (Learning & Research)
**AI excels at**: Explaining concepts, providing examples, research assistance

**Workflow**:
```
1. Ask specific technical questions
2. Request examples and explanations
3. Ask for alternative approaches
4. Research best practices
5. Apply learnings to your code
```

**Example Prompt**:
```
Explain how Rails associations work, specifically has_many :through relationships.

Provide examples of:
- Basic setup
- Common use cases
- Performance considerations
- Best practices

Include code examples that I can run in a Rails console.
```

### 5. üé® Code Formatting (Polish & Consistency)
**AI excels at**: Style compliance, convention adherence, formatting

**Workflow**:
```
1. Generate code with AI
2. Ask AI to format according to Ruby Style Guide
3. Review for Rails conventions
4. Apply consistent formatting
5. Use RuboCop for final validation
```

### 6. üèóÔ∏è Architecture (Human-Led with AI Support)
**AI excels at**: Research, pattern suggestions, documentation

**Workflow**:
```
1. Research architectural patterns with AI
2. Get suggestions for design approaches
3. Review and validate with human expertise
4. Implement with AI assistance
5. Document decisions and rationale
```

## üîÑ Daily Workflow Example

### Morning: Planning & Research
```
1. Use AI to research new features or requirements
2. Get suggestions for implementation approaches
3. Plan the day's development tasks
4. Set up development environment
```

### Development: Implementation
```
1. Generate boilerplate code with AI
2. Implement business logic manually
3. Generate tests with AI assistance
4. Debug issues with AI help
5. Review and refine code
```

### Afternoon: Testing & Refinement
```
1. Run tests and fix issues with AI assistance
2. Generate additional test cases
3. Review code quality and formatting
4. Document changes and decisions
5. Prepare for code review
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Specific Strategies

### GitHub Copilot
- **Best for**: Autocompletion, method generation, test scaffolding
- **Usage**: Keep it running for continuous suggestions
- **Review**: Always review suggestions before accepting

### Claude Code
- **Best for**: Complex debugging, architecture questions, code review
- **Usage**: Use for specific problems and research
- **Context**: Provide full context for better results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-reliance on AI
- **Problem**: Accepting AI suggestions without understanding
- **Solution**: Always review and understand generated code

### 2. Ignoring Rails Conventions
- **Problem**: AI generates non-Rails-like code
- **Solution**: Always specify Rails conventions in prompts

### 3. Poor Error Handling
- **Problem**: AI generates code without proper error handling
- **Solution**: Explicitly request error handling in prompts

### 4. Security Oversights
- **Problem**: AI generates insecure code
- **Solution**: Always review security-sensitive code manually

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Individual Productivity
- Reduced time on boilerplate tasks
- Faster debugging and problem resolution
- Improved test coverage
- Better code consistency

### Code Quality
- Fewer bugs in production
- More maintainable code
- Better documentation
- Consistent style and conventions

## üìö Key Insights from Rich's Experience

### What Works Well
- AI is excellent for Rails scaffolding and boilerplate
- Great for debugging and error analysis
- Helpful for learning new Ruby patterns
- Effective for test generation

### Challenges Faced
- AI sometimes generates non-idiomatic Ruby
- Can miss Rails-specific conventions
- Requires careful review and validation
- Learning curve for effective prompting

### Ruby-Specific Adaptations
- Always specify Rails conventions in prompts
- Review generated code for Ruby idiomaticity
- Use AI for patterns, not business logic
- Maintain human expertise for architecture decisions
