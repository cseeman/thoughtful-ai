# Vibe Coding Workflow

*Based on JetRockets' "Why Ruby on Rails Is the Best Stack for Vibe Coding with AI in 2025"*

## üéØ What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** is a collaborative, human-in-the-loop development approach where developers use natural language prompts to generate code with AI assistance. It's particularly effective with Rails due to Ruby's readability and Rails' convention-over-configuration philosophy.

## üöÄ Why Rails is Perfect for Vibe Coding

### 1. Convention Over Configuration
- **AI Benefit**: Rails conventions help AI understand code structure
- **Developer Benefit**: Predictable patterns make AI suggestions more accurate
- **Example**: AI knows that `User` model goes in `app/models/user.rb`

### 2. Ruby's Readability
- **AI Benefit**: Clean, expressive syntax is easier for AI to understand
- **Developer Benefit**: Generated code is more likely to be idiomatic
- **Example**: `user.posts.published` is clearer than `getPublishedPosts(user)`

### 3. Token Efficiency
- **AI Benefit**: Rails uses "as few tokens as possible per-feature, while still being readable"
- **Developer Benefit**: More efficient AI interactions and better results
- **Example**: `validates :email, presence: true` vs verbose validation code

## üîÑ Vibe Coding Workflow

### Phase 1: Natural Language Planning
```
Developer: "I need a blog system where users can create posts, add tags, and other users can comment."

AI: "I'll help you create a Rails blog system. Let me break this down:
1. User model with authentication
2. Post model with title, content, published_at
3. Tag model with many-to-many relationship to posts
4. Comment model with user and post associations
5. Controllers for CRUD operations
6. Views for the user interface

Should I start with the models and associations?"
```

### Phase 2: Iterative Development
```
Developer: "Start with the models and their relationships."

AI: [Generates models with proper associations]

Developer: "Add validations and some scopes for common queries."

AI: [Adds validations and scopes]

Developer: "Now create the controllers with standard RESTful actions."

AI: [Generates controllers with proper Rails conventions]
```

### Phase 3: Refinement and Enhancement
```
Developer: "Add some business logic - posts should be draft by default, and only published posts should be visible to other users."

AI: [Adds business logic with proper Rails patterns]

Developer: "Generate tests for all of this."

AI: [Generates comprehensive RSpec tests]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Vibe Coding Tools and Setup

### Recommended Tools
- **Cursor**: AI-native editor with project-wide context
- **GitHub Copilot**: Excellent for Rails autocomplete
- **Claude Code**: Terminal-based for complex operations

### Development Environment
```bash
# Set up Rails app with AI-friendly structure
rails new blog_app --database=postgresql
cd blog_app

# Add gems for better AI integration
gem 'rspec-rails'
gem 'factory_bot_rails'
gem 'rubocop'

# Initialize AI tools
# Cursor: Open project in Cursor
# Copilot: Install VS Code extension
# Claude Code: Set up terminal integration
```

## üìã Vibe Coding Best Practices

### 1. Start with High-Level Descriptions
```
‚ùå "Create a method called get_user_posts"
‚úÖ "I need to get all posts for a user, including drafts for the author and only published posts for other users"
```

### 2. Use Rails Conventions in Prompts
```
‚ùå "Make a function to save user data"
‚úÖ "Create a Rails controller action to handle user registration with proper validations and error handling"
```

### 3. Iterate and Refine
```
‚ùå "Create everything at once"
‚úÖ "Start with models, then controllers, then views, then tests"
```

### 4. Provide Context
```
‚ùå "Add authentication"
‚úÖ "Add Devise authentication with user registration, login, and logout functionality"
```

## üéØ Vibe Coding Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Product System
```
Developer: "I need an e-commerce system with products, categories, and shopping cart functionality."

AI: "I'll create a Rails e-commerce system with:
- Product model with name, description, price, inventory
- Category model with hierarchical structure
- Cart model for session-based shopping
- LineItem model for cart contents
- Controllers for product browsing and cart management

Let me start with the models and associations..."
```

### Example 2: Content Management System
```
Developer: "Create a CMS where admins can manage pages, and users can view published content."

AI: "I'll build a Rails CMS with:
- Page model with title, content, slug, published status
- User model with admin role
- Admin interface for page management
- Public interface for viewing published pages
- SEO-friendly URLs and meta tags

Starting with the Page model and admin authentication..."
```

### Example 3: Social Media Features
```
Developer: "Add social features to my blog - users can follow each other and see a feed of posts from followed users."

AI: "I'll add social features with:
- Follow model for user relationships
- Feed generation for followed users' posts
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Activity feed controller
- Real-time updates with Turbo

Let me implement the follow system first..."
```

## üîß Advanced Vibe Coding Techniques

### 1. Context-Aware Development
```
Developer: "In the context of my existing blog app, add a newsletter subscription feature."

AI: [Understands existing structure and adds newsletter functionality that fits]
```

### 2. Performance-Conscious Development
```
Developer: "Add pagination and optimize the post listing for performance."

AI: [Adds pagination with proper database queries and caching strategies]
```

### 3. Security-Focused Development
```
Developer: "Add admin functionality with proper authorization and security measures."

AI: [Implements role-based access control with security best practices]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vibe Coding Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Abstraction
- **Problem**: AI generates overly complex abstractions
- **Solution**: Ask for simple, straightforward implementations

### 2. Missing Business Logic
- **Problem**: AI focuses on technical implementation, misses business rules
- **Solution**: Explicitly describe business requirements

### 3. Inconsistent Patterns
- **Problem**: AI generates code that doesn't match existing patterns
- **Solution**: Provide examples of existing code patterns

### 4. Security Oversights
- **Problem**: AI generates code without security considerations
- **Solution**: Always mention security requirements explicitly

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Development Speed
- Faster feature development
- Reduced boilerplate writing time
- Quicker prototyping and iteration

### Code Quality
- Consistent Rails conventions
- Better test coverage
- Improved documentation

### Developer Experience
- More natural development flow
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better focus on business logic

## üìö Key Insights from JetRockets

### What Makes Rails Great for Vibe Coding
- **Predictable patterns**: AI can understand Rails conventions
- **Clean syntax**: Ruby's expressiveness helps AI generate better code
- **Token efficiency**: Rails uses minimal tokens while remaining readable
- **Convention over configuration**: Less ambiguity for AI to interpret

### Best Practices
- Start with high-level descriptions
- Use Rails conventions in prompts
- Iterate and refine incrementally
- Provide context about existing codebase
- Always review and validate AI output
